            <h1>Body Image and Beauty Standards</h1>
        <img id = "picture2" src = "For Sammmmy.png"/>
            <p> Hello! My name is Sammy, and like almost everyone else in the world, I have struggled with being confident. When you don't feel confident, you probably want your friends to help you get back into a positive mindset. But sometimes things in the media can tear you back down again, and that is a big problem.</p>
            <p> In order to make a difference in the world, you need to be confident. But many people, especially girls, face criticism from others because of their apperance, which drags them down. There are so many different types of people in the world, so it makes no sense to think that there is only one way to be beautiful. Social Media, movies, magazines, and even toys, can promote a body that no one can achieve without photoshop, and women are constantly being called too dark, too light, too fat, or too skinny. This can definitely lower someone's confidence and distract them from chasing their goals.</p>
        <img id="picture" src="barbie.jpg">
            <p>But there are also a lot of positive messages being spread through social media. In fact, Barbie, who is infamous for its dolls with extremely unrealistic beauty standards, is attempting to diversify its products with dolls with different body types, although there are mixed reactions. But positivity is the only way to stop people from comparing themselves to unrealistic images. In fact, "fat shaming" actually leads to consuming more unhealthy foods and gaining more weight. So, just know that you are awesome and anyone who says otherwise doesn't matter to you.</p>
